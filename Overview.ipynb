    "## Baseline comparison\n",
    "\n",
    "Some methods are comparative between models (i.e. can say whether a model does better than another).  \n",
    "Some methods are comparative against some standard baseline (e.g. business as usual model).  \n",
    "Some methods are against an absolute scale.  \n",
    "Some methods give a statistical significance (i.e. judged against likelihood of null hypothesis being accidentally dismissed).  \n",
    "\n",
    "What baselines might we compare to?   \n",
    "*   Business as usual: using previous data as a prediction of the future - if you can't do better than doing nothing...  \n",
    "*   Randomised model: throw previous data at a map (either spatio-temporally randomly or weighted to some population at risk) and use this as a future prediction - if you can't do better than random allocation...   \n",

    "## Do we need to assess praticality of predictions\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Relative vs absolute predictions\n",
    "\n",
    "Are we interested in using absolute predictions or relative predictions? \n",
    "\n",
    "Relative include percentages of crimes e.g. local area as percentage of total area crimes, or total for year.  \n",
    "*   Pros: Good for checking resource allocation within an area; reduces issues of inter-regional variations (e.g. how an area does against the national picture).  \n",
    "*   Cons: No direct comparison with national picture.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, for validation, is there much difference?  \n",
    "\n",
    "Ranges used for percentages etc. can be absolute (from zero to some maximum e.g. UK or city region)   \n",
    "*   Pros: Good for inter-regional comparison.  \n",
    "*   Cons: Can give a poor impression in inter-regional comparisons, where local results may be good compared with range.  \n",
    "\n",
    "or from local minimum to local maximum.   \n",
    "*   Pros: Gives a more reasonable intra-regional comparison. \n",
    "*   Cons: Have to be aware of zeroing minima where there are no zeros in areas. Removes inter-regional comparison option.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Limits assessment of predictions outside of range.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In general, absolute figures are generated by model predictions, and can be compared locally with absolute figures, however, the resulting statistics are then biased by the magnitude of the data. To resolve this issue, statistics are often normalised by dividing by the range of the data (for example, in the Normalised Root Mean Square Error), however, which range to take is often unclear. It could be the range of the prediction; real data; combined data; or data from some larger system depending on the data available and the use case. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Are we interested in a single scale, multiple scales, or cross-scale?\n",
    "\n",
    "Single scale statistics are ok for policy or practice driven analysis where the scale is fixed and known.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple scale statistics give the comparative statistic for a range of scales. This helps, in that point-by-point measures at a single scale don't cope well with the situation where a prediction is right, but slightly out geographically. In general (strange effects like negative spatial autocorrelation aside), the correlation between two spatial datasets will increase with scale as datasets overlap more (does weighting for area have an effect? would this be reasonable? It would essentially be an averaging window). Given this, the user has to weigh up the smallest resolution with the most appropriate correlation, looking for the smallest areas that give a good prediction: to some extent we can think of this as the optimum prediction scale for the model. We hope this expresses as a kink in the validation graph, though this may not be optimal as it relates to the spatial distribution of the datasets. If predictions are not on a raster or point basis (for example, they're on a street network), what does scale mean? How to we assess how close a prediction has to be on a street network to count as a good prediction?\n",
    "\n",
    "Cross-scale statistics unify multiple scales to a single statistic that represents the significance across multiple scales. The different scales can be combined with weightings, or as binary masks, or linearly. \n",
